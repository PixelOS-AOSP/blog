# December 2024 Update

As 2024 draws to a close, we're excited to release PixelOS 15 Beta with November security patches. We've brought back most of the features from PixelOS 14.

The source code for PixelOS 15 Beta has been released under the [PixelOS-Fifteen](https://github.com/PixelOS-Fifteen)
organization. It is based on the November SPL and aligns with the AOSP tag `android-15.0.0_r5`.
